# Protocol — Paired-Mode Contract

**Tier:** recommended
**Applies to:** Step 4 (Component Variant), Bootstrap (Step 6)

The single canonical reference for the StackShift ↔ UI Forge handshake. Other paired protocols (`accessibility`, `brand`, `claude-design-handoff`, `auto-verify-hook`, `variant-router`) link to this document instead of restating its rules.

**This protocol does not introduce behavior.** It documents the invariants that already govern the boundary between the two skills, in one place, so changes to the contract are reviewable atomically.

## What "paired mode" means

Paired mode is detected by UI Forge when `.stackshift/installed.json` exists in the project root. UI Forge surfaces it in `CONVERT_VARIANT` output as `PAIRED: stackshift x.y.z`. While paired:

- StackShift owns: schema, types, `index.tsx` wiring, `Variants` map, props interface, GROQ.
- UI Forge owns: variant body (JSX, classNames, library swaps, FORGE NOTES content).
- Neither skill writes into the other's territory.

### Named export exception (UI Forge ≥ 0.2.7A)

The Variant Router contract requires every variant file to end with a named re-export:

```typescript
export { MySection_X };
```

Prior to UI Forge 0.2.7A, `validate-contract.js` flagged this as a violation (extra named export). From 0.2.7A onward, `validate-contract.js` auto-detects `.stackshift/installed.json` and exempts exactly one named export that matches the default export name. In non-paired mode, named exports remain forbidden.

This is a behaviorally correct outcome — no StackShift changes are needed. This section exists so the rule is auditable in one place.

## Skill-root resolution (`${UI_FORGE_SKILL_DIR}`)

Both bootstrap and Step 4 need to invoke UI Forge scripts. The canonical resolution is:

1. **Prefer `detect.sh`** (UI Forge ≥ 0.1.9): run `sh <candidate>/scripts/detect.sh` against each candidate path below; the first that succeeds prints the absolute skill root to stdout.
2. **Fallback list** (used when `detect.sh` is missing on older UI Forge installs):

| Order | Path |
|---|---|
| 1 | `$UI_FORGE_SKILL_DIR` env var if set |
| 2 | `.claude/skills/ui-forge/` (project-scope Claude Code) |
| 3 | `.agents/skills/ui-forge/` (project-scope agents) |
| 4 | `.codex/skills/ui-forge/` (legacy — pre-0.1.9A Codex CLI install) |
| 5 | `~/.claude/skills/ui-forge/` (global Claude Code) |
| 6 | `~/.agents/skills/ui-forge/` (global agents) |
| 7 | `~/.codex/skills/ui-forge/` (legacy — pre-0.1.9A global Codex CLI install) |

If none resolve, halt with the install instructions documented in `workflow/4-variants.md`.

## Marker fields

Two files mediate the handshake. Each field has a single owner — never both.

### `.stackshift/installed.json` — StackShift-owned

| Field | Written by | Consumed by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `skillVersion` | CLI + bootstrap | UI Forge (paired-mode banner) | Surfaces in `PAIRED:` line |
| `protocols` | CLI + bootstrap | (informational) | Materialized set |
| `a11yRequired` | bootstrap (when `accessibility` selected) | UI Forge `detectSignals()` | Triggers `+A11Y` |
| `pendingDesignArchBridge` | bootstrap (when arch absent) | bootstrap (next run) | Deferred bridge payload |
| `uiForgeIntegration` | bootstrap (Step 6d) | bootstrap (next run) | Detection state cache |

### `design/design-arch.json` — UI Forge-owned

| Field | Written by | Consumed by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `componentLib`, `usedComponents`, `usedLibraries`, `tailwind.*`, `globalCss`, `patterns.*` | UI Forge `scan.js` | UI Forge `invoke.js` | Project authority |
| `designStandards.stackshiftVariantRouter` | bootstrap (Step 6a) | UI Forge `loadDesignStandards()` | Variant Router rules |
| `designStandards.stackshiftComponentStandard` | bootstrap (Step 6a) | UI Forge `loadDesignStandards()` | Component conventions |
| `designStandards.brand` | bootstrap (when `brand` selected) | UI Forge `detectSignals()` | Triggers `+BRAND` |

### Design standards key disambiguation

Two separate `designStandards` keys cover "StackShift" concerns. They serve different purposes and must not be confused:

| Key | Written by | Points to | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `stackshift-ui` | UI Forge `scan.js` (when `--theme stackshift`) | skill-internal path or project copy of UI library standards | UI component library conventions — how `@stackshift-ui/<section>` components are structured |
| `stackshift-section-variants` | StackShift bootstrap (Step 6a `stackshiftComponentStandard`) | `design/standards/stackshift-section-variants.md` | Variant coding rules — imports, null handling, function structure, TypeScript conventions for variant files |

`invoke.js` loads both keys when present and injects them into variant generation context. Because the two keys cover different surfaces (library structure vs. variant authoring rules), they compose without duplication. However, any field in both would produce conflicting instructions — keep them non-overlapping.

### `_paired` mirror block (optional, additive)

Bootstrap may write a denormalized mirror of relevant StackShift markers into `design/design-arch.json` so UI Forge can read everything from one surface:

```json
{
  "_paired": {
    "stackshiftVersion": "0.1.9",
    "a11yRequired": true,
    "contractVersion": "1.0.0",
    "protocols": ["variant-router", "accessibility"]
  }
}
```

`_paired` is read-only from UI Forge's perspective. The canonical write target is still `.stackshift/installed.json`. Older UI Forge versions ignore unknown top-level keys, so this block is forward-compatible.

**Known limitation (UI Forge < rescan-merge fix):** When `scan.js` re-runs, it overwrites `design-arch.json` and silently drops the `_paired` block. Paired-mode tooling that reads `design-arch.json` for StackShift markers will stop finding them until the next bootstrap pass re-writes the block. The fix belongs in UI Forge `scan.js` (preserve existing top-level keys not owned by scan). Until that fix ships, run bootstrap again after any UI Forge rescan to restore the `_paired` block.

## Flag refusal matrix (UI Forge under paired mode)

UI Forge refuses these flags when `.stackshift/installed.json` is present:

| Flag | Reason |
|---|---|
| `--creative` | Greenfield generation conflicts with contract-first handoff |
| `--diff` | Surgical edit on existing files conflicts with body-only mode |
| `--preview` | HTML snapshot disabled in paired mode (use Sanity Studio for review) |

Flags that **work** under paired mode:

| Flag | Notes |
|---|---|
| `--handoff <url>` | Composes with `+CLAUDE_DESIGN`. Requires `claude-design-handoff` protocol. |
| `--validate-input` | Pre-flight contract check (Step 4d.1). |
| `--verify` | Adds CONTRACT CHECK requirement to FORGE NOTES. |
| `--a11y` | Redundant when `a11yRequired: true` is set, but harmless. |
| `--rescan` | Re-runs `scan.js` before generation. |

For iterative regeneration of a completed variant with `--diff`, run UI Forge **standalone** (outside Step 4) — the result replaces the variant file in place.

---

## Modifier composition

Multiple modifiers stack. The composition rules:

| Combination | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `+A11Y` + `+BRAND` | Both addenda compose; FORGE NOTES has `A11Y` and `BRAND` sub-blocks |
| `+A11Y` + `+CLAUDE_DESIGN` | Both compose; A11Y rules apply to handoff layout |
| `+BRAND` + `+CLAUDE_DESIGN` | Both compose; brand tokens validated against handoff token remap |
| `+CLAUDE_DESIGN` + `+DIFF` | **Refused** (DIFF is `CONVERT_SECTION` only) |
| `+CLAUDE_DESIGN` + `+CREATIVE` | **Refused** (CREATIVE refused under paired mode anyway) |

---

## Contract version handshake

The Variant Router contract version flows between three locations:

1. **StackShift props interface** — `/** @contract-version 1.0.0 */` JSDoc tag above `export interface SectionProps`. Authoritative source.
2. **UI Forge generated FORGE NOTES** — `// @contract-version 1.0.0` line in the CONTRACT sub-block. Echoed from (1).
3. **UI Forge contract package** — `packages/variant-contract/contract.schema.json` has a `compatibility` field listing supported StackShift contract versions. Bumps require coordinated edits.

Current version: **1.0.0**.

When bumping the contract version:

1. Update `references/versions.md` (StackShift) and the `compatibility` block in `<UI_FORGE>/packages/variant-contract/contract.schema.json` together.
2. Bump the JSDoc tag in every section's `index.tsx` props interface (StackShift territory — done by hand or scripted).
3. Generate a new variant — UI Forge writes the new version into FORGE NOTES.
4. Document the breaking change in both repos' change logs.

UI Forge treats an unrecognised contract version as a FORGE NOTES warning, not a hard failure.

## Runtime detection

Paired mode is auto-detected by UI Forge — no flag required. Detection order:

1. UI Forge reads `.stackshift/installed.json` from the project root.
2. If present, UI Forge sets `paired = true` and reads `a11yRequired`, `skillVersion`.
3. The `PAIRED: stackshift <version>` line appears in `CONVERT_VARIANT` stdout.

To run UI Forge in standalone mode against a StackShift project (e.g. for `--diff`), invoke from a different working directory or temporarily rename `.stackshift/`. There is no in-band opt-out flag.

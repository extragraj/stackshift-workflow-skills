# Bootstrap — First-Run Install Flow

> **Who reads this:** the AI, on first invocation of the StackShift skill in a new project.
> **Trigger:** `.stackshift/installed.json` does not exist in the project root.

The goal of bootstrap is to materialize selected protocols, create project infrastructure (_registry.json, _template/, references/), and drop a marker file recording what was installed.

---

## Step 1 — Detect install state

Check for `.stackshift/installed.json` in the project root.

- **Exists** → skill is already bootstrapped. Skip the rest of this file and return to the workflow.
- **Does not exist** → continue.

---

## Step 2 — Read the protocol registry

Load the protocol manifest from the skill folder:

- `protocols/_registry.json`

Each entry carries a `tier` (`required` / `recommended` / `optional`), a `title`, a `summary`, and either a `file` (single markdown) or a `dir` (directory to copy recursively).

**Do not load the actual protocol content yet.** The registry is intentionally small so this step stays cheap.

**Note:** `seeds/_registry.json` exists in the skill but seeds are not materialized to projects.

---

## Step 3 — Prompt the user for install mode

Present the five modes using the `ask_user_input_v0` tool if it is available in your runtime (Claude Code). On all other runtimes — including Codex CLI — ask in plain conversation and wait for the user's typed reply. The interaction is identical; only the mechanism differs. See `bootstrap/modes.md` for the authoritative definitions.

> **Quick-reference summary to show the user:**
>
> | Mode | What it does |
> |---|---|
> | **None** | Install nothing. `/docs/` stays empty. Skill falls back to bundled defaults at lookup time. |
> | **Required** | Install only protocols with `tier: required`. Minimal customizable surface. |
> | **Recommended** *(default)* | Install all `tier: required` + `tier: recommended`. The sensible baseline. |
> | **All** | Install everything in both registries, including `tier: optional`. |
> | **Interactive** | Checkbox list — required items pre-checked, recommended items pre-checked, optional items unchecked. |

Default recommendation: **Recommended**.

---

## Step 4 — Resolve the selection

Based on the chosen mode, build the `selectedProtocols` list:

| Mode | Protocols selected |
|---|---|
| None | `[]` |
| Required | `tier === "required"` |
| Recommended | `tier === "required" OR tier === "recommended"` |
| All | every entry |
| Interactive | user's checked items from prompt |

For **Interactive**, show a protocol selection prompt. Each item renders as `[tier] title — summary`. Required items are pre-checked AND the user is warned (but not blocked) if they uncheck one: "This is a required protocol — unchecking means the workflow will fall back to the skill-bundled copy instead of a project copy you can customize. Continue?".

---

## Step 5 — Materialize protocols and project infrastructure

### A. Materialize Selected Protocols

For each selected protocol:

```
if entry.file is set:
  source:      <skill>/protocols/<entry.file>
  destination: <project>/docs/protocol/<entry.file>
  action:      copy as single file

if entry.dir is set:
  source:      <skill>/protocols/<entry.dir>/
  destination: <project>/docs/protocol/<entry.dir>/
  action:      copy directory recursively
```

**Copy verbatim.** Do not rewrite, summarize, or reformat. The project copies are meant to be customized by the team — preserving the original as the starting point is important.

**Conflict rule:** If a destination already exists (file or directory), do NOT overwrite silently. Ask per-entry: *skip*, *overwrite*, or *write alongside as `<n>.new.md` / `<dir>.new/`*.

### B. Create Project Protocol Registry

Create `<project>/docs/protocol/_registry.json`:

```json
{
  "protocols": [],
  "note": "Add custom project protocols here. They will be discovered alongside skill protocols."
}
```

This empty registry allows teams to add custom protocols that are discovered alongside skill protocols.

### C. Copy Protocol Template

Copy `<skill>/protocols/_template/` → `<project>/docs/protocol/_template/` recursively.

This provides a starting point for creating complex multi-file protocols.

### D. Create References Directory

Create `<project>/docs/references/` directory (empty initially).

Add a README file: `<project>/docs/references/README.md`:

```markdown
# Custom References

Add custom reference lookups here for project-specific protocols.

These augment the skill's standard references without modifying them.

## Example

Create files like:
- `custom-lookups.md` - Custom data tables
- `project-types.md` - Project-specific type definitions
- `field-patterns.md` - Project field patterns
```

### E. Do NOT Materialize Seeds

Seeds follow standard strategies and load from skill when needed.

### F. Directory Structure

After materialization, the project should have:

```
/docs/
├── protocol/
│   ├── _registry.json          # Project protocol registry (empty)
│   ├── _template/              # Complex protocol template
│   └── [materialized protocols] # Selected from bootstrap
│
└── references/                 # Custom reference lookups (empty)
    └── README.md
```

Note: No `/docs/seed/` directory is created.

---

## Step 6 — Bridge `designStandards` for `ui-forge`

After protocols are materialized, bridge the `variant-router` protocol (and any component-rendering protocols) into the `designStandards` field that `ui-forge` reads from `design/design-arch.json`.

### 6a — Build the `designStandards` payload

Scan the materialized protocols for component-rendering relevance. At minimum, include the `variant-router` protocol. Use `design/standards/stackshift-ui.md` as the primary standards path if it exists (created in Step 6f below); fall back to the materialized protocol file for backwards compatibility with projects that pre-date v0.1.8.

```json
{
  "designStandards": {
    "stackshiftVariantRouter": "./docs/protocol/variant-router.md",
    "stackshiftComponentStandard": "./design/standards/stackshift-ui.md"
  }
}
```

If `design/standards/stackshift-ui.md` does not exist (e.g. bootstrap was skipped or project pre-dates v0.1.8), fall back to:

```json
{
  "designStandards": {
    "stackshiftVariantRouter": "./docs/protocol/variant-router.md",
    "stackshiftComponentStandard": "./docs/protocol/variant-router.md"
  }
}
```

If the `brand` protocol is in the materialized set, add it to the payload:

```json
{
  "designStandards": {
    "stackshiftVariantRouter": "./docs/protocol/variant-router.md",
    "stackshiftComponentStandard": "./design/standards/stackshift-ui.md",
    "brand": "./design/standards/brand.md"
  }
}
```

### 6b — Apply the payload

Check for `design/design-arch.json` at the project root:

- **If it exists:** Read the file, merge the `designStandards` object into it (preserve all existing keys), and write it back.
- **If it does not exist:** Record the intended `designStandards` payload in `.stackshift/installed.json` under a `pendingDesignArchBridge` key. This payload will be applied when `ui-forge`'s `scan.js` creates the file (see Step 6c).

```json
{
  "pendingDesignArchBridge": {
    "designStandards": {
      "stackshiftVariantRouter": "./docs/protocol/variant-router.md"
    }
  }
}
```

### 6c — Detect and integrate `ui-forge`

Resolve the `ui-forge` skill directory using this lookup order (first match wins):

1. Environment variable `UI_FORGE_SKILL_DIR` if set
2. `.claude/skills/ui-forge/` (project-scope Claude Code install)
3. `.agents/skills/ui-forge/` (project-scope agents install)
4. `.codex/skills/ui-forge/` (project-scope Codex CLI install)
5. `~/.claude/skills/ui-forge/` (global Claude Code install)
6. `~/.agents/skills/ui-forge/` (global agents install)
7. `~/.codex/skills/ui-forge/` (global Codex CLI install)

**If `ui-forge` is installed and `design/design-arch.json` is absent:**

Prompt the user:

```
? ui-forge is installed but design/design-arch.json is missing.
  Run ui-forge scan now? (Y/n)
```

On confirmation:

1. Execute `node ${UI_FORGE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/scan.js`
2. Apply the `pendingDesignArchBridge` payload from Step 6b to the newly-created `design/design-arch.json`
3. Remove the `pendingDesignArchBridge` key from `.stackshift/installed.json`

On decline or if `ui-forge` is not installed:

- Record the integration state in `.stackshift/installed.json` (see Step 6d)
- The `pendingDesignArchBridge` payload remains for future application

### 6d — Record `ui-forge` integration state

Add to `.stackshift/installed.json`:

**If `ui-forge` was found and scan completed:**

```json
{
  "uiForgeIntegration": {
    "installed": true,
    "scanCompleted": true,
    "scanTimestamp": "2026-04-14T12:34:56Z",
    "uiForgeVersion": "<read from ui-forge skill.version>",
    "skillDir": "<resolved path>"
  }
}
```

**If `ui-forge` was found but scan was declined:**

```json
{
  "uiForgeIntegration": {
    "installed": true,
    "scanCompleted": false
  }
}
```

**If `ui-forge` was not found:**

```json
{
  "uiForgeIntegration": {
    "installed": false
  }
}
```

This lets later StackShift invocations detect stale scans (e.g. after `ui-forge` is upgraded) and re-run.

### 6e — Version compatibility check

After detecting `ui-forge`, read its `skill.version` file and compare against the declared compatibility range in `references/versions.md`.

**If mismatched:** Emit a non-fatal warning:

```
⚠️ ui-forge version mismatch

  Installed: 0.2.1
  Compatible range: ≥0.1.1, <0.2.0

  See references/versions.md for the compatibility table.
  Step 4 handoff may produce unexpected results.
```

**If compatible or not installed:** No action needed.

### 6f — Seed `design/standards/`

Create the `design/standards/` directory if it does not exist.

**`design/standards/stackshift-ui.md`** (skip if file exists):

Write this file with the StackShift-UI conventions UI Forge needs to read during generation:

```markdown
# StackShift UI — Component Standards

These conventions apply to every variant generated in this project.

## Import rules
- Always import the props interface from `"."` (the section index file), never from `@stackshift-ui`.
- Component library imports come from `@stackshift-ui/<section>`.

## Null handling
- Use `?? undefined` for every field extracted from `data?.variants`.
- Return `null` when required props are absent — never render a broken state.
- Use ternary guards (`{title ? <Heading title={title} /> : null}`) rather than `&&`.

## Function structure
- Default export: the main variant component.
- Named export: re-export the function (`export { MySection_X }`).
- Helper functions below all exports, not above.
- Defaults in destructure signature, not inside the function body.

## TypeScript
- All props optional (`?`) — Sanity data can always be null/undefined.
- No `any` types.
- Prefer composing existing interfaces over defining new ones.
```

**`design/standards/brand.md`** (only if `brand` protocol is in the materialized set; skip if file exists):

Write a starter brand document:

```markdown
# Brand Standards

> Replace this starter with your project's actual brand guidelines.

## Voice and tone
[Describe writing register, formality, sentence structure guidelines]

## Color palette
[List named color roles: primary, secondary, neutral, accent — with usage rules]

## Typography
[Map heading levels to font / weight / size; describe body text defaults]

## Imagery
[Describe photography style, illustration tone, icon set restrictions]
```

---

## Step 7 — Write the install marker

Create `<project>/.stackshift/installed.json`:

```json
{
  "skillVersion": "<read from skill.version>",
  "installedAt": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "mode": "recommended",
  "protocols": [
    { "id": "factory-function-pattern", "tier": "required", "file": "factory-function-pattern.md" },
    { "id": "sub-field-visibility", "tier": "required", "file": "sub-field-visibility.md" },
    { "id": "field-reuse-first", "tier": "recommended", "file": "field-reuse-first.md" }
  ]
}
```

**Note:** Seeds field is not included because seeds are not materialized to projects.

**Accessibility marker:** If the `accessibility` protocol is in the materialized set, add `"a11yRequired": true` to the file. Absence means "not requested" — do not write the field at all when the protocol is not selected. UI Forge treats absence and `false` identically (no SIGNAL_A11Y).

```json
{
  "skillVersion": "<read from skill.version>",
  "installedAt": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "mode": "recommended",
  "protocols": [...],
  "a11yRequired": true
}
```

### Canonical `installed.json` Shape

The file can eventually hold additional fields written by the AI agent at bootstrap time. The full possible shape is:

```json
{
  "skillVersion": "0.1.8",
  "installedAt": "2026-04-14T00:00:00Z",
  "mode": "recommended",
  "protocols": [
    { "id": "factory-function-pattern", "tier": "required", "file": "factory-function-pattern.md" }
  ],
  "a11yRequired": true,
  "pendingDesignArchBridge": {
    "designStandards": {
      "stackshiftVariantRouter": "./docs/protocol/variant-router.md",
      "stackshiftComponentStandard": "./design/standards/stackshift-ui.md"
    }
  },
  "uiForgeIntegration": {
    "installed": false,
    "scanCompleted": false,
    "scanTimestamp": "2026-04-14T00:00:00Z",
    "uiForgeVersion": "0.2.0",
    "skillDir": "/abs/path/to/ui-forge"
  }
}
```

**Field ownership:**

| Field | Written by | When |
|-------|-----------|------|
| `skillVersion` | CLI + bootstrap | Every install / repair |
| `installedAt` | CLI + bootstrap | Every install / repair |
| `mode` | CLI + bootstrap | Every install / repair |
| `protocols` | CLI + bootstrap | Every install / repair |
| `a11yRequired` | AI agent (bootstrap Step 7) | When `accessibility` protocol is materialized |
| `pendingDesignArchBridge` | AI agent (bootstrap Step 6b) | When `design/design-arch.json` is absent |
| `uiForgeIntegration` | AI agent (bootstrap Step 6d) | After `ui-forge` detection |

Fields added by the AI agent are optional and only appear when relevant. The CLI writes only the first four fields and never removes agent-added fields during re-install.

This file is the source of truth for what has been installed. Future invocations read it to:

- Skip bootstrap entirely (it exists → we're done).
- Detect registry additions that could be offered to the user with a non-blocking "new protocols available" notice (optional future feature).

---

## Step 8 — Write `.forgeignore` defaults

If `.forgeignore` already exists at the project root, do nothing — the file is user-authored and must not be overwritten.

If it does not exist, create it with Sanity + Next.js defaults:

```
# StackShift — Sanity + Next.js defaults
studio/
.sanity/
.next/
dist/
build/
out/
coverage/
```

This prevents UI Forge's `scan.js` from walking build artifacts, Sanity Studio internals, and output directories during project scanning. User edits to this file always take precedence — UI Forge's ignore-file resolution gives `.forgeignore` the highest project-level priority.

**Field ownership note:** `.forgeignore` is written once during bootstrap. It is never overwritten on subsequent invocations.

---

## Step 9 — Report and return

Print a summary:

```
Bootstrapped StackShift skill (mode: recommended)
  /docs/protocol/           ← [N] protocols ([r] required, [rec] recommended)
  /docs/protocol/_registry.json  ← Project protocol registry (empty)
  /docs/protocol/_template/ ← Complex protocol template
  /docs/references/         ← Custom reference lookups (empty)
  design/standards/         ← stackshift-ui.md [+ brand.md if brand protocol]
  .forgeignore              ← [written / already exists]
  .stackshift/installed.json written
  a11yRequired: [true / not set]

ui-forge integration: [detected / not found]
  design/design-arch.json:  [bridged / pending / N/A]

Edit protocols under /docs/protocol/ freely. Your edits take precedence over
the skill's defaults at lookup time.

Add custom protocols to /docs/protocol/_registry.json for discovery.
```

Return to the workflow step the user originally invoked. Do not treat bootstrap as the answer to their actual request.

---

## Idempotency and bootstrap behavior

- Running bootstrap when `.stackshift/installed.json` exists is a no-op.
- Bootstrap only runs once per project.
- New protocols can be added directly to `/docs/protocol/_registry.json` for discovery.
- If project infrastructure files (_registry.json, _template/, references/) are missing, they can be re-created manually by copying from skill or running bootstrap again after deleting the marker file.
